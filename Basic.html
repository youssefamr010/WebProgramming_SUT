<h1> Youssef Amr </h1>
<h2> I'm Junior Pentester </h2>
<h2>With strong background in Pentesting , Network Security , AWS Cloud</h2>
<h3>About me :</h3>
<h4>dedicated Software Tester and QA Team Lead, I bring a strong track record of ensuring the quality, performance, and security of both web and mobile applications. My expertise extends across manual and API testing, test automation, and detailed bug reporting, all aimed at driving seamless user experiences and successful product launches.

With a deep understanding of cybersecurity principles, I focus not only on product quality but also on identifying and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities throughout the software development lifecycle.

I have proudly been recognized among DEPI’s Top Achievers, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and excellence. My credentials include earning the Cloud Essentials Certificate, which has strengthened my knowledge in cloud infrastructure and architecture.

My hands-on experience includes an internship at MCS as a Cybersecurity Intern, where I gained practical expertise in network maintenance, cloud architecture design, and ethical hacking. Additionally, during my internship at Petrojet, I explored the IT structure of large-scale organizations and developed a solid understanding of data center operations.

Currently, I work remotely with Invisible Technologies as a QA Engineer, collaborating across global teams and evaluating various Large Language Models (LLMs) for major clients such as Meta and Google. This role has refined my skills in remote teamwork, data-driven testing, and AI system evaluation.

I’m passionate about leveraging my technical, analytical, and leadership skills to ensure the highest standards of software quality, cybersecurity, and innovation in every project I undertake
